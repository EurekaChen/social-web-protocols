    The Social Web Protocols are a collection of standards which enable various aspects of decentralised social interaction on the Web. This document describes the purposes of each, and how they fit together.
  </section>
  <section id="sotd"></section>

  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>People and the content they create are the core components of the social web; they make up the social graph. This document describes a standard way in which people can:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>connect with other people and subscribe to their content;</li>
      <li>create, update and delete social content;</li>
      <li>interact with other peoples' content;</li>
      <li>be notified when other people interact with their content;</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>regardless of <em>what that content</em> is or <em>where it is stored</em>.</p>
    
    <p>These components are core building blocks for interoperable social systems.</p>
    
    <p>Each of these components can be implemented independently as needed, or all together in one system, as well as extended to meet domain-specific requirements. Users can store their social data across any number of compliant servers, and use compliant clients hosted elsewhere to interact with their own content and the content of others. Put simply, this document tells you, according the recommendations of the Social Web Working Group:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>how to <a href="#reading">expose/consume</a> social content (reading).</li>
      <li><a href="#content-representation">what to post</a>, and where to, in order to <a href="#creating-content">create</a>, <a href="#updating">update</a> or <a href="#deleting">delete</a> content.</li>
      <li>how to <a href="#subscribing">ask for notifications</a> about content (subscribing).</li>
      <li>how to <a href="#delivery">deliver notifications</a> about content or users (delivery).</li>
      <li>how to expose <a href="#profiles">profiles</a> and <a href="#relationships">relationships</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <section id="contents">
      <h3>Contents</h3>
    
      <p>This is an overview of the current state of specifications of the Social Web Working Group. This document also describes Social Web Working Group specifications in context of W3C recommendations and relevant drafts from other communities outside of the Social Web Working Group. As many of these specs are under ongoing development, this document is subject to change alongside them.</p>

      <p>You might also want to take a look at the Working Group's <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/Requirements">Social API Requirements</a> to understand the division of concerns.</p>
      
      <p>Due to the diversity of viable technical approaches proposed within the Working Group, several specifications on the recommendation track provide overlapping functionality through differing mechanisms. Thus this document exists to provide informative guidance on how and when to implement the various specifications, as well as normative instructions to implement bridges between recommendations with overlapping functionality. This is currently a recommendation-track document, but may finally be published as a Note.</p>

        <p>In order to support [[Activitypub]] clients, content MUST be available as [[ActivityStreams2]] JSON. This could be directly, through content negotiation (when requested with an appropriate <code>Accept</code> header), or via a <code>rel="alternate" type="application/activity+json"</code> link (which could be to a different domain, for third-party services which dynamically generate [[ActivityStreams2]] JSON on behalf of the publisher). </p>

  <section id="creating-content">
    <h2>Creating content</h2>

    <p>Content generated through a client (such as a web form, mobile app, smart device) is created when it is sent to a server for processing, where it is typically stored and usually published (either publicly or to a restricted audience). Clients and servers may independently support creating, updating and deleting; there are no dependencies between them. Authentication and authorization for creating content is left out of scope.</p>

    <p><strong>[[Activitypub]]</strong> clients discover the <code>outbox</code> of the authenticated user from their JSON profile, then make an HTTP POST request with an appropriate [[ActivityStreams2]] activity as a JSON payload. [[Activitypub]] requires use of the [[ActivityStreams2]] vocabulary and syntax, which may be extended with JSON-LD. The URL of the created resource is generated at the discretion of the server. This is an appropriate protocol to use when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You want to send/receive a JSON or JSON-LD payload.</li>
      <li>Your data is described with [[ActivityStreams2]] (optionally extensible via JSON-LD).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>[[Micropub]]</strong> clients discover the Micropub endpoint from the current user's homepage (likely entered by the user as part of authentication) from a <code>rel="micropub"</code> link, then make a <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> POST request containing the key-value pairs for the attributes of the object being created. The URL of the created resource is generated at the discretion of the server. Micropub requires use of the Microformats 2 [[h-entry]] vocabulary, as well as a set of reserved attributes as commands to the server. Any additional key names sent outside of this vocabulary may be ignored by the server.</p>

    <p>[[Micropub]] requests may alternatively be sent as a JSON payload, the syntax of which is derived from the Microformats 2 parsing algorithm. This is an appropriate protocol to use when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You want to send/receive a form-encoded or JSON payload.</li>
      <li>Your data is described with the [[h-entry]] syntax and vocabulary.</li>
      <li>You can rely on out-of-band agreements between clients and servers for vocabulary extensibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>[[LDP]]</strong> servers are written to by sending an HTTP POST request to a <code>Container</code> (any resource on the server which returns <code>Link: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container&gt;; rel="type"</code>), containing an RDF payload with attributes of the object being created. An identifier for the created resource is generated at the discretion of the server. The URL is created by appending the identifier to the URL of the <code>Container</code> that was posted to. [[Solid]] and [[AnnotationProtocol]] both use slightly altered [[LDP]] to create content; [[Solid]] restricts use to only Basic Containers, while the [[AnnotationProtocol]] specifies the [[AnnotationVocab]] and primary syntax as JSON-LD. This is an appropriate protocol to use when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your data is represented as RDF.</li>
      <li>Clients and servers are vocabulary agnostic.</li>
      <li>You prefer a more RESTful API.</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="updating">
      <h3>Updating</h3>
      
      <p>Content is updated when a client sends changes to attributes (additions, removals, replacements) to an existing object. If a server has implemented a <a href="#delivery">delivery</a> or <a href="#subscribing">subscription</a> mechanism, when an object is updated, the update MUST be propagated to the original recipients using the same mechanism.</p>

      <p><strong>[[Activitypub]]</strong> clients replace the complete object by sending an HTTP POST request containing an [[ActivityStreams2]] <code>Update</code> activity to the <code>outbox</code> of the authenticated user, where the <code>object</code> is a nested object, including an <code>id</code>, which serves as the replacement.</p>

      <p class="issue">ActivityPub currently only supports updates of a whole object at once. <a href="https://github.com/w3c-social/activitypub/issues/85">Issue 85 for partial updates</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>[[Micropub]]</strong> clients perform updates, as either form-encoded or JSON POST requests, using the <code>mp-action=update</code> parameter, as well as a <code>replace</code>, <code>add</code> or <code>delete</code> property containing the updates to make, to the Micropub endpoint (discovery described in <a href="#creating-content">creating</a>). <code>replace</code> replaces all values of the specified property. If the property does not exist already, it is created. <code>add</code> adds new values to the specified property without changing the existing ones. If the property does not exist already, it is created. <code>delete</code> removes the specified property; you can also remove properties by value by specifying the value.</p>

      <p><strong>[[LDP]]</strong> clients perform replacement-style updates by sending an HTTP PUT request to the URL of the object to be updated. Partial-style updates are performed with an HTTP PATCH request.</p>
      

    </section>
    <section id="deleting">
      <h3>Deleting</h3>
      
      <p>Content is deleted when a client sends a request to delete an existing object. If a server has implemented a <a href="#delivery">delivery</a> or <a href="#subscribing">subscription</a> mechanism, when an object is deleted, the deletion MUST be propagated to the original recipients using the same mechanism.</p>

      <p><strong>[[Activitypub]]</strong> clients delete an object by sending an HTTP POST request containing an [[ActivityStreams2]] <code>Delete</code> activity to the <code>outbox</code> of the authenticated user. Servers MUST <em>replace</em> the <code>object</code> of this activity with a tombstone and return a <code>410 Gone</code> status code, or just return a <code>404 Not Found</code>, from its URL.</p>

      <p><strong>[[Micropub]]</strong> delete requests are two key-value pairs, in form-encoded or JSON: <code>mp-action</code>: <code>delete</code> and <code>url</code>: <code>url-to-be-deleted</code>, sent to the Micropub endpoint (discovery described in <a href="#creating-content">creating</a>).</p>

      <p><strong>[[LDP]]</strong> deletes are performed by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the URL of the object to be deleted.</p>

      <p>Subscription requests (requests to be added to this collection) are made by the subscriber's server <code>POST</code>ing a <code>Follow</code> Activity to the target's inbox. The target server then SHOULD add the subscriber to the target's Followers collection. Exceptions may be made if, for example, the target has blocked the subscriber.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, the subscriber's server (upon receipt of the <code>Follow</code> in their <em>outbox</em>) MAY add the target to the subscriber's <em>Following</em> collection.</p>

The subscriber sends the keyword <code>sub</code> followed by an empty space and then the URI of the resource, to the target's websockets URI. The target's server sends a websockets message containing the keyword <code>pub</code>, followed by an empty space and the URI of the resource that has changed, whenever there is a change.

Documents contain links to the sources of received webmentions along with the content. Every time the document is updated, including when new incoming webmentions are added, the server (re-)sends webmentions to every link. Thus, all documents which originally sent a webmention receive a webmention back, enabling them to parse the document for changes, and detect new replies in a thread, as well as changes to the original document.

    <section id="targeting-and-discovery">
      <h3>Targeting and discovery</h3>
      <p>The target of a notification is usually the addressee or the subject, as referenced by a URL. Once you have determined your target, you need to discover where to send the notification for that particular target. Do this by fetching the target URL and looking for a link to an endpoint which will accept the type of notification you want to send.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that many potential targets will <em>not</em> be configured to receive notifications at all. To avoid overloading unsuspecting servers with discovery-related requests, your application should employ a "back-off" strategy when carrying out discovery multiple times to targets on the same domin. This could involve increasing the period of time between subsequent requests, or caching unsuccessful discovery attempts so those domains can be avoided in future. You may wish to send a <code>User-Agent</code> header with a reference to the notification mechanism you are using so that recipient servers can find out more about the purpose of your requests.</p>
      <p>Your application should also respect relevant cache control and retry headers returned by the target server.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="delivery-webmention">
      <h3>Webmention</h3>
      <p><strong>[[Webmention]]</strong> provides an API for sending and receiving notifications when a relationship is created between two documents. It works when the two documents are on different domains, thus serving as a federation protocol. This is a suitable notification mechanism when:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You have a document (source) which contains the URL of another document (target).</li>
        <li>The owner of the target has access to view the source (so that their webmention endpoint can parse the source and check the claimed link exists).</li>
        <li>The only data you need to send over the wire are the URLs of the source and target documents (ie. a 'thin ping').</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are no constraints on the syntax of the source and target documents. Discovery of the [[Webmention]] endpoint (a script which can process incoming webmentions) is through a link relation (<code>rel="webmention"</code>), either in the HTTP Link Header or HTML body of the target. This endpoint does not need to be on the same domain as the target, so webmention receiving can be delegated to a third party.</p>

      <p>Webmentions are verified by the server dereferencing the source and parsing it to check for the existence of the target URL. If the target URL isn't found, the webmention MUST be rejected.</p>

      <p>[[Webmention]] uses <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> for the source and target as parameters in an HTTP POST request. Beyond verification, it is not specified what the receiver should do upon receipt of a Webmention. What the webmention endpoint should return on a <code>GET</code> request is also left unspecified.</p>

    <section id="delivery-ldn">
      <h5>LDN</h5>
      <p><strong>[[LDN]]</strong> provides a protocol for sending, receiving and consuming notifications which may contain any content, or be triggered by any person or process. Senders, receivers and consumers can all be on different domains, thus this meets the criteria for a federation protocol. This is a suitable notification mechanism when:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Notifications need to be identifiable with their own URLs and exposed by the receiver for other applications to discover and re-use.</li>
        <li>Notifications are represented as a JSON-LD payload (ie. a 'fat ping').</li>
        <li>You need to advertise constraints on the type or contents of notifications accepted by a receiver.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>[[LDN]] functionality is divided between <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em>. The endpoint to which notifications are sent is the <em>Inbox</em>. Any resource (a user profile, blog post, document) can advertise its inbox so that it may be discovered through an HTTP Link header or RDF body. To this Inbox, senders make a <code>POST</code> request containing the JSON-LD (or other RDF syntax per [[Accept-Post]] negotation with the receiver) payload of the notification. The receiver returns a URL from which the notification data can be retrieved, and also adds this URL to a list which is returned upon a <code>GET</code> request to the Inbox. Consumers retreive the Inbox listing as such, and from there the individual notifications, as JSON-LD (optionally content negotiated to another RDF syntax). An obvious type of consumer is a script which displays notifications in a human-readable way.</p>

      <p>An existing [[LDP]] implementation can serve as an [[LDN]] receiver, by simply advertising any <code>ldp:Container</code> as the Inbox for a resource.</p>

      <p>Receivers are likely to want to constrain the types of notifications they accept. They can do this transparently (such that senders are able to attempt to conform, rather than having their requests rejected opaquely) by advertising data shapes constraints such as [[SHACL]]. Advertisement of such constraints also allows consumers to understand the types of notifications in the Inbox before attempting to retreive them. Receivers may also access control their inbox for example by requiring an <code>Authorization</code> header from both senders and consumers.</p>

This can also be read to understand how a sender of either Webmention or LDN should adapt their discovery and payload in order to send to a receiver of the other.</p>

      <section id="ldn-to-wm">
        <h3>LDN to Webmention</h3>

        <p>Webmention receivers wishing to also accept LDN POSTs at their Webmention endpoint MUST:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertise the webmention endpoint via <code>rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox"</code> in addition to <code>rel="webmention"</code> (in the Link header, HTML body or JSON body of a target).</li>
          <li>Accept POST requests with the content-type <code>application/ld+json</code>. Expect the body of the request to be:
          <pre class="example">
  {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/webmention#",
    "source": { "@id": "https://waterpigs.example/post-by-barnaby" },
    "target": { "@id": "https://aaronpk.example/post-by-aaron" }
  }
          </pre>
          Use the <code>source->@id</code> and <code>target->@id</code> values as the <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> of the Webmention, and proceed with verification.</li>
          <li class="issue">What if a sender doesn't send compacted JSON-LD, or sends something with vocabularies instead of/additional to Webmention?</li>
          <li>If returning a <code>201 Created</code>, it MUST return a <code>Location</code> header with a URL from which the contents of the request posted can be retrieved. <code>202 Accepted</code> is still fine.</li>
          <li>Note than when verifying the source, there's a good chance you can request/parse it as RDF.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="wm-to-ldn">
        <h3>Webmention to LDN</h3>

        <p>LDN receivers wishing to also accept Webmentions to their Inbox MUST:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertise the Inbox via <code>rel="webmention"</code> in addition to <code>rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox"</code> (in the Link header, HTML body or JSON body of a target).</li>
          <li>Accept POST requests with a content type <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. Convert these requests from:
          <pre class="example">
  source=https://waterpigs.example/post-by-barnaby&amp;
  target=https://aaronpk.example/post-by-aaron
          </pre>
          to:
          <pre class="example">
  {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/webmention#",
    "source": { "@id": "https://waterpigs.example/post-by-barnaby" },
    "target": { "@id": "https://aaronpk.example/post-by-aaron" }
  }
          </pre>
          and proceed per [[LDN]]; receivers MAY add other triples at their discretion.</li>
          <li>Receivers MUST return a <code>201 Created</code> with a <code>Location</code> header or <code>202 Accepted</code>.</li>
          <li>Receivers MUST verify the request by retrieving the source document and checking a link to the target document is present. If the Webmention is not verified, recievers MUST NOT keep it.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="wm-as-as">
        <h3>Webmention as AS2</h3>

        <p>A webmention may be represented as a persistent resource with [[ActivityStreams2]]:</p>

        <pre class="example">
  {
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#",
    "type": "Relationship",
    "subject": "https://waterpigs.example/post-by-barnaby",
    "object": "https://aaronpk.example/post-by-aaron"
  }
        </pre>

        <p>A receiver or sender may want to augment this representation with the relationship between the two documents, and any other pertinent data. In the receiver's case, this could be gathered when they parse the source during the verification process. For example:</p>

        <pre class="example">
  {
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#",
    "type": "Relationship",
    "subject": {
      "id": "https://waterpigs.example/post-by-barnaby",
      "name": "Hi Aaron, great post."
    },
    "object": {
      "id": "https://aaronpk.example/post-by-aaron",
      "name": "Aaron's first post."
    }
    "relationship": "inReplyTo"
  }
        </pre>

      <h2>Profiles</h2>

      <p class="issue">Stub, needs expansion</p>

      <p>The subject of a profile document can be a person, persona, organisation, bot, location, … the type of the subject of the profile is not required. Each profile document MUST have a URL which SHOULD return attributes of the subject of the profile; SHOULD return at least one link to <a href="#reading">a stream of content</a> and MAY return content the subject has created. A JSON format MUST be available; other content types MAY be returned as well.</p>
      
      <section id="relationships">
        <h3>Relationships</h3>
      
        <p>Semantics and representation of personal relationships are implementation specific. This specification deals with relationships only when distribution of content is affected, for example if one user ‘friending' another triggers a subscription request from the first user's server to the second. Lists of other relationships MAY be discoverable from a user profile, SHOULD be represented according to the ActivityStremas 2 syntax and MAY (and are likely to) use extension vocabularies as needed.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Activitypub:</strong> When a server receives a <code>Follow</code> Activity in its <code>inbox</code>, the subject is added to a <code>Followers</code> <code>Collection</code>, which is discoverable from the subject's profile.</li>
