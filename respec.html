    The Social Web Protocols are a collection of standards which enable various aspects of decentralised social interaction on the Web. This document describes the purposes of each, and how they fit together.

  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>People and the content they create are the core componants of the social web; they make up the social graph. This document describes a standard way in which people can:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>connect with other people and subscribe to their content;</li>
      <li>create, update and delete social content;</li>
      <li>interact with other people’s content;</li>
      <li>be notified when other people interact with their content;</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>regardless of <em>what that content</em> is or <em>where it is stored</em>.</p>
    
    <p>This provides the core building blocks for interoperable social systems.</p>
    
    <p>These specifications can be implemented independently as needed, or all together in one system, as well as extended to meet domain-specific requirements. Users can store their social data across any number of compliant servers, and use compliant clients hosted elsewhere to interact with their own content and the content of others. Put simply, this specification tells you, according the recommendations of the Social Web Working Group:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>how to <a href="#reading">expose/consume</a> social content (reading).</li>
      <li><a href="#content-representation">what to post</a>, and where to, to <a href="#creating">create</a>, <a href="#updating">update</a> or <a href="#deleting">delete</a> content.</li>
      <li>how to <a href="#subscribing">ask for notifications</a> about content (subscribing).</li>
      <li>how to <a href="#delivery">deliver notifications</a> about content or users (delivery).</li>
      <li>how to expose <a href="#profiles">profiles</a> and <a href="#relationships">relationships</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <section id="contents">
      <h3>Contents</h3>
    
      <p>This is an overview of the current state of specifications of the Social Web Working Group: <a href="http://w3.org/TR/activitystreams">ActiivtyStreams</a>, <a href="http://w3c-social.github.io/activitypub/">Activitypub</a>, <a href="http://micropub.net">Micropub</a> and <a href="http://webmention.net">Webmention</a>. This document also describes Social Web Working Group specifications in context of W3C recommendations outside of the Social Web Working Group where relevant. As many of these specs are under ongoing development, this document is subject to change alongside them.</p>

      <p>You might also want to take a look at the Working Group's <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/Requirements">Social API Requirements</a> to understand the division of concerns.</p>
      
      <p>This document is on track to become a Working Group Note to provide guidence on how and when to implement the various specifications produced.</p>

  <section id="reading">
  <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>If you are a content publisher, this section is about how you should publish your content. If you are a content consumer, this is what you should expect to consume.</p>

    <section id="content-representation">
      <h3>Content representation</h3>
      
      <p>Content MUST be available as [[ActivityStreams2]] JSON and MAY additionally be served as an alternative syntax. If a URL does not return [[ActivityStreams2]] JSON, consumers SHOULD look for the JSON format via a <code>rel="alternate" type="application/activity+json"</code> link (which could be to a different domain, for third-party services which dynamically generate [[ActivityStreams2]] JSON on behalf of the publisher). [[ActivityStreams2]] content MUST be served with the Content-Type <code>application/activity+json</code> or, if necessary for JSON-LD extended implementations, <code>application/ld+json; profile="http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams"</code>.</p>
      
      <p>Content MUST be described using the [[ActivityStreams2]] vocabulary, and MAY use other vocabularies in addition or instead, per the [[ActivityStreams2]] extension mechanism.</p>

      <p>[[ActivityStreams2]] builds upon [[AS1]] and is not fully backwards compatible; <a href="http://w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core#activitystreams-1.0">the relationship between AS1 and AS2 is documented in the AS2 spec</a>. If you have implemented [[AS1]], you should transition to [[ActivityStreams2]].

      <p><strong>[[Activitypub]]</strong> exposes all content as [[ActivityStreams2]] JSON.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="objects">
      <h3>Objects</h3>
    
      <p>All objects MUST have URLs in the <code>id</code> property, which return the properties of an object according to <a href="#content-representation">content representation</a>, and depending on the requester's right to access the content.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="streams">
      <h3>Streams</h3>
    
      <p>Each stream MUST have a URL which MUST result in the contents of the stream (according to the requester's right to access, and could be paged), and MAY include additional metadata about the stream (such as title, description).</p>
      
      <p>Each <a href="#objects">object</a> in a stream MUST contain at least its URL, which can be dereferenced to retrieve all properties of the object, and MAY contain other properties of the object.</p>
      
      <p>One user may publish one or more streams of content. Streams may be generated automatically or manually, and might be segregated by post type, topic, audience, or any arbitrary criteria decided by the curator of the stream. A user <a href="#profiles">profile</a> MAY include links to multiple streams, which a consumer could follow to read or subscribe to.</p>
      
      <p><strong>[[Activitypub]]</strong> specifies four feeds that MUST be accessible from a profile via the following properties:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>inbox</code>: A reference to an [[ActivityStreams2]] collection comprising of all the messages received by the actor.</li>
        <li><code>outbox</code>: An [[ActivityStreams2]] collection comprising of all the messages produced by the actor.</li>
        <li><code>following</code>: An [[ActivityStreams2]] collection of the actors that this actor is following.</li>
        <li><code>followers</code>: An [[ActivityStreams2]] collection of the actors that follow this actor.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>[[Activitypub]] also specifies a further property for accessing additional feeds, which MAY be included in a profile:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>streams</code>: A list of supplementary Collections which may be of interest. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="issue">Activitypub discovery mechanism for this to be specified, likely link relations per <a href="https://github.com/w3c-social/activitypub/issues/50">issue 50</a>.</p>

    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="subscribing">
    <h2>Subscribing</h2>

    <p>An agent (client or server) may <em>ask</em> to be notified of changes to a content object (eg. edits, new replies) or stream of content (eg. objects added or removed from a particular stream).</p>
    
    <p class="issue">Working group has yet to discuss this in depth, subject to significant change.</p>

    <p><strong>[[Activitypub]]</strong> servers distribute the activities of an actor by sending POST requests containing the activities as JSON payloads to the <code>inbox</code> of all actors in an actor's <code>Followers</code> collection. For subscription requests, special behaviour is defined for servers when an [[ActivityStreams2]] <code>Follow</code> activity is appears in an actor's <code>outbox</code> or <code>inbox</code>.</p> 

    <ul>
      <li>For <code>outbox</code> (an outgoing subscription request): The activity is <a href="#delivery">delivered</a> as usual to the <code>object</code>'s <code>inbox</code>, and additionally the <code>object</code> is added to the actor's <code>Following</code> Collection.</li>
      <li>For <code>inbox</code> (an incoming subscription request): The recipient's (the <code>object</code> of the <code>Follow</code> activity) server adds the <code>actor</code> of the <code>Follow</code> activity to the recipient's <code>Followers</code> collection, which subsequently all new activities of the recipient are delivered to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It works when the publisher and subscriber are on different domains, thus serving as a federation protocol. This is a suitable subscription mechanism when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The objects and streams being subscribed to are described with [[ActivityStreams2]].</li>
      <li>The subscriber wants to request updates from a specific actor (rather than objects, streams or threads, see <a href="https://github.com/w3c-social/activitypub/issues/80">issue 80</a>.</li>
      <li>You need to send or receive the whole requested resource over the wire (ie. a 'fat ping').</li>
      <li>You need to send or receive JSON payloads only.</li>
      <li>Subscriptions requests and fulfillment are handled serverside.</li>
      <li>The publisher is aware of who has subscribed; this is a <em>push</em> mechanism.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>[[Solid]]</strong> uses websockets to allow clientside applications to subscribe to changes in objects ([[LDP]] Resources) and streams ([[LDP]] Containers). The websocket endpoint is advertised in the <code>Updates-Via</code> HTTP Link Header. The subscriber sends the keyword <code>sub</code> followed by an empty space and then the URI of the resource, to the target’s websockets URI. The target’s server sends a websockets message containing the keyword <code>pub</code>, followed by an empty space and the URI of the resource that has changed, whenever there is a change. It works when the publisher and subscriber are on different domains, thus serving as a federation protocol. This is a suitable subscription mechanism when:</p>
 
    <ul>
      <li>You live updates over websockets.</li>
      <li>You can send and receive on the URL of the requested resource over the wire (ie. a 'thin ping').</li>
      <li>Subscriptions are requested clientside and fulfilled serverside.</li>
      <li>The publisher is aware of who has subscribed; this is a <em>push</em> mechanism.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>[[Webmention]]</strong> can be deployed as a subscription mechanism through the [[Salmentions]] extension. Documents contain links to the sources of received webmentions along with the content. Every time the document is updated, including when new incoming webmentions are added, the server (re-)sends webmentions to every link. Thus, all documents which originally sent a webmention receive a webmention back, enabling them to parse the document for changes, and detect new replies in a thread, as well as changes to the original document. It works when the publisher and subscriber are on different domains, thus serving as a federation protocol. This is a suitable subscription mechanism when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The subscriber wants to subscribe to a specific thread or object.</li>
      <li>The subscriber has a document which links to that thread or object, and has sent a [[Webmention]] about it.</li>
      <li>The publisher displays links to the sources of received webmentions with their content.</li> 
      <li>The subscriber wants to be notified of further changes to a document linked to.</li>
      <li>The subscriber has implemented [[Webmention]] receiving.</li>
      <li>The publisher is aware of who has subscribed; this is a <em>push</em> mechanism.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Other options yet to be debated...</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web Push Protocol</strong>: The subscriber follows the <code>urn:ietf:params:push</code> link relation to the target’s Push Service, and then <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol-02#section-4">Subscribes for Push Messages</a></li>
      <li><strong>PubSubHubbub</strong>: The subscriber discovers the target’s hub, and sends a form-encoded <code>POST</code> request containing values for <code>hub.mode</code> (“subscribe”), <code>hub.topic</code> and <code>hub.callback</code>. When the target posts new content, the target’s server sends a form-encoded <code>POST</code> to the hub with values for <code>hub.mode</code> (“publish”) and <code>hub.url</code> and the hub checks the URL for new content and <code>POST</code>s updates to the subscriber’s callback URL. (<em>See <a href="http://pubsubhubbub.github.io/PubSubHubbub/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html">PuSH 0.4</a> and <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/How_to_publish_and_consume_PubSubHubbub">How To Publish And Consume PuSH</a></em>)</li>
      <li>Pull, ie. just reading an [[ActivityStreams2]] feed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">Nothing should rely on implementation of a subscription mechanism.</p>
    
    <p>A server may also receive notifications of changes to content it has <em>not subscribed</em> to: see <a href="#delivery">delivery</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="delivery">
    <h2>Delivery</h2>
    
    <p>A user or application may wish to push a notification to another user, for example because they have linked to (replied, liked, bookmarked, reposted, …) their content or linked to (tagged, addressed) the user directly, or to make the recipient aware of a change in state of some document or resource on the Web.</p>

    <p><strong>[[Webmention]]</strong> provides a simple API for sending and receiving notifications when a relationship is created between two documents. It works when the two documents are on different domains, thus serving as a federation protocol. This is a suitable notification mechanism when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You have a document (source) which links to another document (target).</li>
      <li>The owner of the target has access to view the source (so that their webmention endpoint can parse the source and check the claimed link exists).</li>
      <li>The only data you need to send over the wire are the URLs of the source and target documents (ie. a 'thin ping').</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Discovery of the [[Webmention]] endpoint (a script which can process incoming webmentions) is through a link relation (<code>rel="webmention"</code>), either in the HTTP Header or body of the target. This endpoint does not need to be on the same domain as the target, so webmention receiving can be delegated to a third party.</p>

    <p>[[Webmention]] uses <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> for the source and target as parameters in an HTTP POST request. This means a webmention can be triggered from a simple web form or from the commandline with <code>curl</code>. Integration with existing applications is straightforward through translating this form-encoded data into JSON, RDF (<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/webmention#">namespace</a>), or another preferred syntax at the recievers end if necessary. There are no constraints on the syntax of the source and target documents.</p>

    <p>[[Webmention]] can be extended by adding additional parameters to the POST request; applications must have prior agreement in order to understand them, and there is potential for collision of extension terms.</p>
    
    <p><strong>[[Activitypub]]</strong> provides a JSON-based API for sending and receiving [[ActivityStreams2]] activities as notifications. It works when the two documents are on different domains, thus serving as a federation protocol. This is a suitable notification mechanism when:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You describe the notification with [[ActivityStreams2]].</li>
      <li>You need to send or receive the whole notification over the wire (ie. a 'fat ping').</li>
      <li>You need to send or receive JSON payloads only.</li>
      <li>You need to add additional properties to your notifications unambiguously with JSON-LD.</li>
      <li>You need to send the same notification to multiple users from one activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The endpoint which processes incoming notifications is a user's [[Activitypub]] <code>outbox</code>, discoverable from the target user's profile. The recipient user may be addressed directly (through <code>object</code>, <code>target</code>, <code>to</code>, <code>cc</code>, and/or <code>bcc</code>), and/or inferred as the owner of another resource which is addressed (through <code>object</code>, <code>target</code> and/or <code>inReplyTo</code>).</p>

    <p>An [[Activitypub]] server delivers the entire activity to all discovered endpoints as a JSON payload of an HTTP POST request.</p>

    <p>An [[Activitypub]] server receiving such an activity must verify the notification is accurate (by fetching the source, or some prior trust arrangement with the sender, eg. through an authentication token or digital signature).</p>

    <p>[[Activitypub]] delivery can be extended through the [[ActivityStreams2]] extension mechanism, with JSON-LD.</p>

    <p class="issue">Add Solid Notifications for pure RDF usage.</p>

    <p class="note"><em>Note: we need to leave it open for users to refuse content they have not explicitly subscribed to, ie. nothing else should rely on implementation of Delivery.</em></p>
